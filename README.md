# Tender-Management-System
Welcome to the Tender Management System, a Java-based console application designed to streamline the process of managing tenders and bids. This application consists of two main phases: the Admin phase and the User phase, each offering distinct functionalities to effectively manage the tendering process.

Features:
Admin Phase:
Add Tenders: Admins can effortlessly add new tenders to the system, providing all the necessary details such as tender title, description, deadline, and more.
User Phase:
Bid Submission: Registered users can place their bids for the listed tenders. They can input their bid amount along with any supporting comments.
Admin Phase (Post Bidding):
Assign Tenders: Admins have the authority to assign tenders to users based on their submitted bids. This process ensures that the tender is awarded to the most suitable bidder.
Additional Features:
Activity Tracking: Both admins and users can track their activities within the system. Admins can monitor tender and bid activities, while users can keep an eye on their bidding history.
